# Java Core Concepts Learning Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project serves as a structured learning resource for core Java concepts. Each package represents a different Java topic, and within each package, there is a class with a `main` method that can be uncommented and executed to see the concept in action.  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. **Explore Packages** – Each package covers a different core Java topic.  
2. **Uncomment & Run** – Uncomment the `main` method in any class and execute it.  
3. **Read Comments** – Each class includes detailed explanations to reinforce learning.  
4. **Expand the Project** – Add new Java concepts over time to deepen understanding.  

## 📚 Concepts Covered  

### 1️⃣ Comparable & Comparator (`com.java.comparable_comparator`)  
- **Comparable** – Interface for defining the natural ordering of objects.  
- **Comparator** – Interface for custom sorting logic.  
- **Example:** Sorting objects using both `Comparable` and `Comparator`.  

### 2️⃣ Multithreading (`com.java.multithreading`)  
- Understanding **threads**, **Runnable**, and **synchronization**.  
- Implementing threads using:  
  - ✅ **Extending `Thread` class**  
  - ✅ **Implementing `Runnable` interface**  
- **Example:** **Printing Even & Odd Numbers Using Two Threads**  
  - Two threads communicate using `wait()` and `notify()` to print numbers sequentially.
