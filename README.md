Java Core Concepts Learning Project
Overview
This project serves as a structured learning resource for core Java concepts. Each package represents a different Java topic, and within each package, there is a class with a main method that can be uncommented and executed to see the concept in action.

How to Use
Explore Packages ‚Äì Each package covers a different core Java topic.
Uncomment & Run ‚Äì Uncomment the main method in any class and execute it.
Read Comments ‚Äì Each class includes detailed explanations to reinforce learning.
Expand the Project ‚Äì Add new Java concepts over time to deepen understanding.
Concepts Covered
1Ô∏è‚É£ Comparable & Comparator (com.java.comparable_comparator)
Comparable ‚Äì Interface for defining the natural ordering of objects.
Comparator ‚Äì Interface for custom sorting logic.
Example: Sorting objects with both Comparable and Comparator.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Multithreading (com.java.multithreading)
Understanding threads, Runnable, and synchronization.
Implementing threads using:
Extending Thread class
Implementing Runnable interface
Example: Printing Even & Odd Numbers Using Two Threads
Two threads communicate using wait() and notify() to print numbers sequentially.
üöÄ More concepts will be added as the project grows!
